# COVIDualize
In this project, we will develop a model to display the predicted spread of COVID-19 given the impact of different scenarios on the spread of COVID-19. These scenarios include: discovering and developing vaccinations, committing to social isolation, having a total population lockdown, or not performing any virus countermeasures. The aim is to properly visualize the effects of such scenarios through an interactive web interface. The interface will include a map that changes with the change of a certain number of parameters with the display of relevant statistics.
